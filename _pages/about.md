I am a Senior Algorithm Expert at Alibaba Cloudâ€™s Apsara Lab and Tongyi Lab. I obtained my Ph.D. degree and B.S. degree both from Zhejiang University in 2018 and 2012, respectively. 

My current research focuses on large language models for `reasoning` and `content safety`. Prior to this, 
I contributed to the nationwide implementation of the City Brain Project in multiple cities across China, with a focus on applying artificial intelligence to urban governance in order to enhance administrative efficiency and decision-making.


:sparkles: :smile: We are recruiting interns who are interested in large language model `reasoning`. Please feel free to contact me.
