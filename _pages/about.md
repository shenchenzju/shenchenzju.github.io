I am a Senior Algorithm Expert at Alibaba Cloudâ€™s Apsara Lab and Tongyi Lab. My research focuses on large language models for `reasoning` and `content safety`. I have published over 20 papers in conferences such as (ML) NeurIPS / ICLR / ICML, (CV) CVPR / ECCV,  (NLP) ACL / NAACL, (DM) KDD, and top-tier journals such as TIP / TMM / TCSVT / TKDE.

Prior to my work in the field of large language models, I was engaged in the nationwide implementation of the City Brain project across multiple cities in China, with a focus on applying artificial intelligence to urban governance in order to enhance administrative efficiency and decision-making.


:sparkles: :smile: We are recruiting interns who are interested in large language model `reasoning`. Please feel free to contact me.
